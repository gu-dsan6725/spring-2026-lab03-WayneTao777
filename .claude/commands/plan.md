Create a detailed implementation plan for: $ARGUMENTS

Derive a short kebab-case feature name from the task description (e.g., "add cross-validation" becomes "cross-validation", "build EDA pipeline" becomes "eda-pipeline").

Write the plan to `.scratchpad/<feature-name>/plan.md` with the following structure:

## Plan: [Title]

### Objective
Brief description of what will be built.

### Steps
Numbered list of implementation steps, each with:
- What file(s) will be created or modified
- What the code will do
- Any dependencies on previous steps

### Technical Decisions
- Libraries and tools to use
- Data structures and patterns
- Any trade-offs considered

### Testing Strategy
How the implementation will be verified.

### Expected Output
What files and artifacts will be produced.

After writing the plan, tell the user to review it and provide feedback before proceeding with implementation. Do NOT start building until the user approves the plan.
